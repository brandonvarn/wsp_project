		<p class="left">Hello my name is Brandon C Varn I am a full-time student studying Web Design &amp; Development at Full Sail University. I am also the owner of <a href="accuratecredit.com">accuratecredit.com</a>. I have created this library of components to drive my best effort forward to help build a more dynamic and interactive website.</p>

		<h2>About the project</h2>
		<p>After looking at templatemonster.com I have picked the following design elments for development</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Header</li>
			<li>Nav</li>
			<li>Table</li>
			<li>CTA</li>
			<li>Footer</li>

		<h2>Components</h2>
			<section id="header">
				<h3>Component: Header</h3>
					<a href="images/header.png" target="image"><img src="images/header.png" class="right" alt="header image"></a>
					<p class="left">The header is the most important aspect to the page.  It sets the tone and allows the user to grasp right away what the company is about.</p>
					<p>I would build this by using these properties:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>CSS:</li>
							<ol>
								<li>Height</li>
								<li>Width</li>
								<li>Float</li>
							</ol>
						<li>Having login information listed in the right corner</li>
						<li>Having contact information listed on the right below login</li>
					</ul>
			</section>		
			<section class="clear">
				<h3>Component: Nav</h3>
				<a href="images/nav.png" target="image"><img src="images/nav.png" class="right" alt="nav image"></a>
				<p>The NAV is probably going to be the most used part of any website.  It links to all the main pages and is usually the first place a user will go when they need to browse your website.</p>
				<p>If I was to build a NAV right now I would make a unordered list.  Then design it through CSS.  Make it display the direction I want (vertical or horizontal).  Apply any highlight elements or animation.  You can even start to add things like jQueary</p>
				</section>
				<section class="clear">
					<h3>Component: Table</h3>
					<a href="images/table.png" target="image"><img src="images/table.png" class="right" alt="table image"></a>
					<p>Tables are used for many things now.  Before they were used for styling as well as displaying of information. But with today's CSS3 tables can now be properly used.  On almost any business site you will find a table.  Usually displaying the benefits of different packages offered.  Or displaying what product is the best.</p>
					<p>I would build this by creating the table in html with html5 markup.  I would then go through with css and style it how I wanted it. For example if I had a list of products I wanted to place down I would place each column with a different color shade.  And have the inside's have a border to it.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="clear">
					<h3>Component: CTA</h3>
					<a href="images/cta.png" target="image"><img src="images/cta.png" class="right" alt="cta image"></a>
					<p>A call to action is dependont on color, scale, language, and imagery.  You need to have the proper planning and forethought to achieve a well designed CTA.  A CTA is mainly used to sell whatever it is you are trying to sell on any page.  It can be rock climbing by showing a mountain top with a man on top.  Or it can be a great sale on beauty products being displayed.</p>
					<p>If I was to build a CTA I would first sit down and decide how I would want it to look.  I would then decide if it is purely text based (most are not).  Once that has been decided I would use CSS to make sure it has the look I want.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Component: Footer</h3>
					<a href="images/footer.png" target="image"><img src="images/footer.png" class="right" alt="footer image"></a>
					<p>I have started to notice a lot in responsive sites that the footer is more and more important.  The footer can contain very important information like a home button or disclaimers.  The footer has many uses it just depends on what kind of site you are building.  For our personal company site we use the footer for all our main links (a lot of this has to do with making sure keywords are used enough times and appropriately) as well as a disclaimer.</p>
					<p>I would build the footer a lot like the nav.  I would line the links on the bottom and probably but the years the business has been doing business.</p>

			<h2>Featured Component</h3>
			<a href="images/featured.png" target="image"><img src="images/featured.png" class="right" alt="featured image"></a>
			<h3>Choice</h3>
			<p>I chose the header for my featured item.  I am using the header from First National Bank or FNB.  FNB is a banking site that uses the header image above it's main content.  You can see the link bar as well as the login information shown.  The border is 0 around the image and the width would be 100% in this case it was set at 960 px.</p>
			<h3>Font's and Colors</h3>
			<p>The font used is Sans Serif.  No google font's or any other loaded font is used.  So they took a very minimalist approach to the design.  The font color used is white on everything.</p>
			<h3>CSS</h3>
			<p>The header is actually a image with div tag's placed above it for the login and link bar.  The image has no border and is 960px wide and 260px tall.</p>
